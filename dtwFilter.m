% input inputAudio - the normalized audio input in the time domain

% input audioBank  - an matrix with X the normalized pre-recorded audio
%                    inputs in the time domain
% input audioName  - an array of string correlating to the word of the

% output matchedSignal - the string of the word that is matched
