Notes:
--------------------------------------------------
On PIC32MX 2xx PIMS, connect pin RA1(SDI1) to pin RA2(SDO1). On PIC32MX 430 PIM, connect RF2(SDI1) to RD4(SDO1). 
All other devices connect pin RF7(SDI1) to pin RF8(SDO1).

For PIC32MX 220/250 PIMS, Explorer-16 LEDs are unconnected and must be soldered to the test points on top of the PIM as stated below.

--------------------------------------------------
Soldering Instructions for PIC32MX 220/250 PIMS:
--------------------------------------------------
The test points (TP) are located on top of the PIM and must be connected as follows to the Explorer-16 for proper LED functionality.

TP19 to D3  (RA0 to LED0)
