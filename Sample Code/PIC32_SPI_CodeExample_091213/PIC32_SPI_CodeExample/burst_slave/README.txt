PIC32_SPI\burst_slave

--------------------------------------------------
Code Example Description:
--------------------------------------------------
Example for the usage of the SPI Peripheral Lib.

This test assumes that a master device is connected to our test SPI device and that it sends us data packets. The slave device, after receiving the 
data from the master, switches to master mode and relays data back to the master. The master can then verify the integrity of the packet. 
This is the SPI slave code. The slave has to be launched first and has to be waiting when the master begins transmitting data.
